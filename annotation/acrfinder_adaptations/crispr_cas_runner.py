	*****************************************************************************************************
	Purpose:
		Handles execution of CRISPRCasFinder.
		Parses CRISPRCasFinder output and creates a fasta file with CRISPR spacers found.
		Creates a file that blocks (masks) all spacers from the parsed organism.
		uses blastn to find occurences of all CRISPR spacers within the organism using the masked organism file.

	Author:
		Javi Gomez - https://github.com/rtomyj wrote the version 1.0.
		Haidong Yi - https://github.com/haidyi revised the codes, remove some bugs, wrote the version 2.0. 
	Project:
		This work is advised by Dr. Yanbin Yin at UNL - yyin@unl.edu

	Functionality:
		Uses makeblastdb to create a database using the masked FNA file.
		Uses blastn along with the database created and fasta file of spacers to find other occurences of the spacers within the same organism.
	Args:
		SELECT_SPACER_FASTA - fasta file containing all CRISPR spacers found on organism
		MASKED_FNA - file of organism that has masked regions where CRISPR spacers were found
		DIR - directory to store files
	Returns:
		BLAST_FILE - string, path to file containing blast results

'''
	Functionality:
		Runs CRISPRCasFinder.
		Creates a fasta file containing all CRISPR spacers found.
		Creates a masked fna file that takes the orginal FNA file and puts non sensical but valid characters in the locations where spacers were found.
			This will prevent spacers from matching themselves but will preserve the length of the sequence and location of all other sequences.
		Runs blastn.
	Args:
		CRISPR_CAS_FINDER_EXECUTABLE - file used to execute CRISPRCasFinder program
		CRISPR_CAS_FINDER_SO - file needed by CRISPRCasFinder
		FNA_FILE - path to FNA file of organism to study
		OUTPUT_DIR - directory to store any output
		INTERMEDIATES - directory to store intermediate files
		EVIDENCE_LEVEL - evidence level desired of the spacers
	Returns:
		BLAST_FILE - string, path to file containing blast results
