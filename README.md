# CRISPa

This repository contains all scripts etc. related to the master thesis project:


**Exploring the impact of CRISPR-Cas and anti-CRISPR on host-virus interactions in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*** - 
*Large-scale genomic analysis in the context of human phage therapy*
(June 2020, Master of Bioinformatics at KU Leuven university)

---


This project consisted first of the **assembly** of around 600 in-house sequenced isolates. Next, these were complemented with 4812 genomes issued from the NCBI repository and the whole dataset was **annotated** then for CRISPR-Cas and anti-CRISPR presence. Finally, several sets of infectivity data to Pseudomonas phages were integrated and **statistical analyses** were conducted to find the influence of CRISPR-Cas and anti-CRISPR on the susceptibility of a *P. aeruginosa* strain.

In addition to a folder per aforementioned stage, a markdown file with other used commands is available.
